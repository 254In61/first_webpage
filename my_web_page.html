<h1>The Techie cyclist's journey</h1>
<p>
Been wondering, what does it take to be a Web designer or a Frontend developer?
Is it interesting?
</p>
<p>
I have been a Networks engineer for the last 13 years or so and currently fiddling with automation aspects of networks.
These are mainly in Python & Ansible.
While at it , I wanted to build a different skill-set for the fun of it. Maybe this hobby could end up being my side-hustle??
<br>
<br>
So, this is my first web-page. It makes me smile looking at it!!
<br>
Just basic HTML & CSS used in this one. Next step is to learn how to code in Javascript.
